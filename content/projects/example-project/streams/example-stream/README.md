# Example Stream

A **stream** is a work package or sub-project within a larger project. Think of it as a focused area of research or a specific experiment series.

## Purpose

This example stream demonstrates:
- How to organize updates chronologically
- Where to store documentation
- How to manage data files

## Updates

Updates are stored in the `updates/` directory. Each update is a markdown file with:
- A date-based filename (e.g., `2025-11-05-first-update.md`)
- Frontmatter with metadata (date, type, tags)
- Markdown content documenting your work

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains:
- Protocols and procedures
- Safety guidelines
- Reference materials
- How-to guides

## Data

The `data/` directory stores:
- CSV files
- JSON data
- Small datasets (<10MB recommended)
- For larger files, use external storage and link here

## Getting Started

1. Create your first update in `updates/`
2. Add any relevant documentation to `docs/`
3. Commit and push to your `draft` branch
4. Publish when ready!
